```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.dim =c (8,7))
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
data = read.csv(here::here("results", "macd_results.csv"))
```


```{r fs, echo=FALSE}

  ggplot(data, aes(experiment, fs_percentile, color = taxa)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(vars(referenceID))

```


```{r mete, echo=FALSE}

  ggplot(data, aes(experiment, mete_percentile, color = taxa)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(vars(referenceID))

```


* change in S and N?
* taxa
* experiment, system type

Would prefer something more standardized, at least as a starting point.

Off the cuff...

* a lot of things *do* deviate
* deviations are more pronounced for FS vs METE
* but I don't see a simple obvious clear pattern of the manipulated sites (`experiment` = 1 or 2 in these plots) being more unusual (lower %ile score) than the control sites.
